# Thyroid Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning classifiers to predict thyroid disease based on a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The primary goal is to classify whether a patient has thyroid disease or not, helping in early detection and diagnosis.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing: Normalization, label encoding, and feature selection.
- Implemented machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, Neural Networks.
- Random Forest achieved **98% accuracy** on the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Thyroid Disease Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can download the dataset from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Thyroid+Disease).
