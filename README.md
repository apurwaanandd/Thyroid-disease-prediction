The thyroid disease prediction project uses the different ML classifier to predict thyroid disease based on a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It involves preprocessing steps like data normalization, label encoding, and feature selection to improve model accuracy. The goal is early detection of thyroid disease.
